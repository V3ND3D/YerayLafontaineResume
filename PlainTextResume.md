# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am an aspiring IT and cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience supporting systems setup, secure configurations, and data integrity under compliance-driven environments. My recent role as a Database Specialist for a federal contracting company sharpened my understanding of data security standards, especially when handling sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII).

While I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, I’ve already developed a strong foundation through real-world technical tasks, such as configuring and securing 10 macOS devices manually without enterprise tools, enforcing least-privilege access, firewall setup, and documenting secure processes. I am actively studying for industry-standard certifications, including CompTIA Security+ and Network+, to solidify my professional knowledge and credibility further.

I take pride in being a fast learner, an analytical thinker, and someone who thrives under pressure. I’m passionate about threat detection, system hardening, and contributing to organizations that value proactive IT operations and security awareness. I’m ready to bring this drive and discipline to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be excited to bring my skills, growing knowledge, and commitment to excellence to your organization.

**Sincerely,**  
Yeray Lafontaine
